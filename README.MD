# COCKROACH game
##GWT
Lead your cockroach to eat as much crumbs as possible.<br>
Watch out for poisoned crumbs and time left<br>
<br>
### Moving:
Move your cockroach with mouse.<br>
Watch - it dies when clicked on it<br>
each crumb eaten adds additional time<br>
poisoned crumbs add negative time amount !! <br>
ENJOY!!<br>

## Usage

```
For IntelliJ just clone the project, set JDK to 1.8 (the most steady for GWT)
Run/Debug Configurations for GWT
and don't forget to install the GWT plugin for IntelliJ
don't forget to download the latest GWT - ex. 2.9.0 and add it in library

For Eclipse it is almost the same.
NetBeans - I don't know
Notepad too.


```

It is in development stage, so look forward for future features and don't care about the bugs, this is my first web app in GWT ;P:

```
Future TODO is -> much to do
```
